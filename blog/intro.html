                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers, I have always wanted to be a Blogger. I donâ€™t remember when I fell in love with blogging, but over the years, my passion for traveling has increased. Over the past few months, I have started living this dream, and it gives me so much joy, that I have been recently travelling a lot, visiting new places and trying new Cuisines and try to bring in as much as content possible for my blogs.<br><br>

                        My parents have always supported my dreams and aspirations. According to them, the only way to achieve all your goals is to work very hard and never give up on them. They have never imposed themselves and demanded that any of their children become what they want us. Instead, they wanted my siblings and me to choose careers and a life that will give us joy and stability.
